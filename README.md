# connect-server

This middleware sets or removes the `Server` header on HTTP responses. The
`Server` header contains information about the software used to handle a
request.  This header is used by services that gather metrics about the web,
including [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/) and [Netcraft](http://www.netcraft.com/).

## Installation

    $ npm install connect-server

## Usage

To set the `Server` header on responses, simply use `server` middleware and
specify server details.

    var serverHeader = require('connect-server');

    app.configure(function() {
      app.use(serverHeader({ name: 'Node.js', version: '0.6.14' }));
    });
    
An array can also be used, to specify an significant subcomponents of a server.

    app.configure(function() {
      app.use(serverHeader([{ name: 'Node.js', version: '0.6.14' },
                            { name: 'Express', version: '2.5.9' }]));
    });

To remove any `Server` header from the response, use `serverHeader` middleware
and specify `null`.

    var poweredBy = require('connect-powered-by');

    app.configure(function() {
      app.use(serverHeader(null));
    });
    
## Security

Revealing the software version of the server may make the system more vulnerable
to attacks, by disclosing details that confirm known security holes, if any.
This risk should be assessed before enabling this functionality on an untrusted
network.

## Tests

    $ npm install --dev
    $ make test
